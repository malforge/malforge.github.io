# Space Engineers – Programmable Block API Documentation

Welcome to the **unofficial** API reference for scripting in the *Space Engineers* Programmable Block.
This site documents the classes, interfaces, and methods available to in-game scripts.

## 🧭 How to Use This Site

**Sidebar Navigation:** Click the hamburger menu (☰) to browse namespaces and types. The tree structure mirrors the C# API organization - expand sections to find what you need.

**Search:** Use the search box in the sidebar to find types and members quickly. Fair warning - it's pretty basic and won't win any awards for being smart like Google, but it gets the job done for most searches! Try prefixing with `T:` for types or `M:` for members if you need to narrow things down.
