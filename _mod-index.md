This site documents the classes, interfaces, and methods available to mod developers.

## 🧭 How to Use This Site

**Sidebar Navigation:** Click the hamburger menu (☰) to browse namespaces and types. The tree structure mirrors the C# API organization - expand sections to find what you need.

**Search:** Use the search box in the sidebar to find types and members quickly. Fair warning - it's pretty basic and won't win any awards for being smart like Google, but it gets the job done for most searches! Try prefixing with `T:` for types or `M:` for members if you need to narrow things down.

> **Experimental Status**  
> This documentation has been thoroughly tested for the Programmable Block API, but the Mod API is new territory.
> The Mod API is **much larger** (thousands more types) and **more complex** (deeper inheritance hierarchies).
> If you spot something wrong, please report it so we can fix it.
