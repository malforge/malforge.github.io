# Space Engineers – Mod API Documentation

Welcome to the **unofficial** API reference for modding *Space Engineers*.
This site documents the classes, interfaces, and methods available to mod developers.

> **⚠️ WARNING: This documentation generator is experimental for the Mod API.**  
> The documentation generator has been thoroughly tested for the Programmable Block API, but the Mod API is new territory.
> There may be rendering issues, missing information, or other anomalies we haven't discovered yet.
> The best way to find problems is to use it - so please report any issues you encounter!

## 🧭 How to Use This Site

**Sidebar Navigation:** Click the hamburger menu (☰) to browse namespaces and types. The tree structure mirrors the C# API organization - expand sections to find what you need.

**Search:** Use the search box in the sidebar to find types and members quickly. Fair warning - it's pretty basic and won't win any awards for being smart like Google, but it gets the job done for most searches! Try prefixing with `T:` for types or `M:` for members if you need to narrow things down.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Experimental Status
This documentation is generated using the same tools as the Programmable Block API, but the Mod API is:
- **Much larger** - thousands more types and members to document
- **More complex** - deeper inheritance hierarchies and more intricate relationships
- **Less tested** - we're working out the kinks as we go

**Expect:**
- Possible rendering issues or formatting problems
- Edge cases in documentation generation we haven't encountered yet
- Potential missing or incorrectly parsed documentation

**Help us improve it!** If you spot something wrong, please report it so we can fix it.

## Getting Started with Mod Development

I also maintain **MDK2 (Malware's Development Kit 2)** for any fully C# capable IDE (tested with Visual Studio, VSCode, and JetBrains Rider), which adds IntelliSense, templates, and automatic deployment to the game.

➡️ [Available here](https://github.com/malforge/mdk2) if that sounds useful to you.

Updates happen when time allows - some gaps and lag behind game updates are unavoidable.

The Mod API documentation is generated from the game's assemblies and may not capture all nuances of the modding system.
