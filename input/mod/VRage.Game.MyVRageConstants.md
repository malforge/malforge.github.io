**Assembly:** VRage.Game.dll

```csharp
public class MyVRageConstants
```

All common constants for use in game engine. Note: The name is probably temporary - avoiding colision with Sandbox.Engine.Utils during sandbox removement. I guess it can be renamed to MyConstants once we are finished with sandbox deletion.
