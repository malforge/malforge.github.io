## Summary

```csharp
public void Normalize()
```

Turns the current vector into a unit vector. The result is a vector one unit in length pointing in the same direction as the original vector.

## Summary

```csharp
public static Vector2D Normalize(Vector2D value)
```

Creates a unit vector from the specified vector. The result is a vector one unit in length pointing in the same direction as the original vector.

## Returns

[Vector2D](VRageMath.Vector2D)

## Parameters

* [Vector2D](VRageMath.Vector2D) value
## Summary

```csharp
public static void Normalize(ref Vector2D value, out Vector2D result)
```

Creates a unit vector from the specified vector, writing the result to a user-specified variable. The result is a vector one unit in length pointing in the same direction as the original vector.

## Parameters

* [Vector2D](VRageMath.Vector2D) value
* [Vector2D](VRageMath.Vector2D) result
