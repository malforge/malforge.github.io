## ⚠️ Important Notes

This documentation is **community-maintained** and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Keen Software House**.

This is a **one-person, free-time project**, maintained with care for the Space Engineers community.  
Updates happen when time allows - some gaps and lag behind game updates are unavoidable.

## Getting Started with Script Development

I also maintain **MDK2 (Malware's Development Kit 2)** for Visual Studio users, which adds IntelliSense, templates, and one-click deployment to the game.

➡️ [Available here](https://github.com/malforge/mdk2) if that sounds useful to you.
